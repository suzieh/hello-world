A little about me!

Hello GitHub user! My name is suzieh. I am an aspiring developer / analyst based out of various parts of the United States. I'm mostly familiar with C++, Python, R, and JavaScript. Thanks for taking a look around. I hope you find my projects intriguing.

All you need to know about me is "Lord of the Rings" will forever be my favorite trilogy. Also I love pistachios.
